# WeatherScape

**Desctiption:**
This program uses Open Weather's free api to get access weather for all cities around the world. With some implementation of pygame I created a simple GUI that allows the user to search any city they would like, and have the information displayed as well as an image of the classification of weather.

**Before Starting:**
To use this progeam you must sign up for a free Open Weather Account. After signing up you can find your API Key here, https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys. Copy this key and place it in the quotes for api_key.
